# Spotify to YouTube

- [ ] Extract all the playlists data from Spotify (scrap it, don't use its API, there are legal implications).
- [ ] Store all this data in CSV (?).
- [ ] Use the YouTube API (?) [maybe Selenium] to create the playlists based on the collected data.

## Install

Make sure you activated the virtual environment.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
